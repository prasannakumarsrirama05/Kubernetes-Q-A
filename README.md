This glossary provides definitions for various terms and concepts related to Kubernetes:

- **Affinity**: In Kubernetes, affinity is a set of rules that give hints to the scheduler about where to place pods. It helps in specifying the preferred or required locations for running pods based on node attributes, pod labels, or inter-pod relationships.

- **Annotation**: An annotation is a key-value pair that is used to attach arbitrary non-identifying metadata to Kubernetes objects. It provides a way to add additional information or context to objects without affecting their core functionality.

- **API Group**: An API group is a set of related paths in the Kubernetes API. It provides a way to organize and categorize resources based on their functionality or domain. API groups enable extensibility and allow users to define their own custom resources and controllers.

- **API Server**: The API server, also known as kube-apiserver, is a component of the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API, which allows users to interact with the cluster and manage resources. The API server acts as the front end for the control plane and handles all API requests.

- **Applications**: The applications layer in Kubernetes refers to the environment where various containerized applications run. It encompasses the deployment and management of application workloads using Kubernetes resources such as pods, deployments, and services.

- **cgroup (control group)**: A cgroup, short for control group, is a Linux kernel feature that provides resource isolation, accounting, and limits for groups of processes. In Kubernetes, cgroups are used to enforce resource allocation and limits for containers running on each node in the cluster.

- **Cluster**: A cluster in Kubernetes is a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. It forms the foundation for deploying and managing applications using Kubernetes. A cluster consists of multiple nodes working together to provide a scalable and resilient environment.

- **Container**: A container in Kubernetes refers to a lightweight and portable executable image that contains software and all of its dependencies. Containers provide isolation and encapsulation, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments.

- **Container Environment Variables**: Container environment variables are name=value pairs that provide useful information into containers running in a pod. They can be used to configure application settings, pass runtime parameters, or provide secrets and credentials.

- **Container Runtime**: The container runtime is the software responsible for running containers on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. It manages the lifecycle of containers, including creating, starting, stopping, and deleting containers. Examples of container runtimes include Docker, Containerd, and CRI-O.

- **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**: The Container Runtime Interface (CRI) is an API specification that defines how container runtimes interact with the kubelet,

 which is the primary node agent responsible for managing containers. CRI enables interoperability between different container runtimes and the kubelet.

- **Control Plane**: The control plane in Kubernetes is the container orchestration layer that manages and controls the cluster. It consists of a set of components, including the API server, controller manager, scheduler, and etcd, that work together to provide cluster management, scheduling, and resource allocation.

- **Controller**: In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of the cluster and make or request changes where needed to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state. Controllers ensure the desired state of resources, such as pods or services, is maintained even in the presence of failures or changes.

- **CustomResourceDefinition**: CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a Kubernetes feature that allows users to define and use custom resources in the Kubernetes API server without building a complete custom server. CRDs enable the extension of Kubernetes with domain-specific resources and controllers.

- **DaemonSet**: A DaemonSet is a Kubernetes resource that ensures a copy of a pod is running on each node in a cluster. It is used for deploying system-level daemons or agents that need to run on every node, such as log collectors, monitoring agents, or network proxies.

- **Data Plane**: The data plane in Kubernetes is the layer that provides capacity such as CPU, memory, network, and storage to run containers and connect them to the network. It encompasses the infrastructure resources required for the execution and communication of containerized workloads.

- **Deployment**: A Deployment is a Kubernetes API object that manages a replicated application. It creates and manages pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas are running, and handles scaling, rolling updates, and rollback operations for the application.

- **Device Plugin**: A Device Plugin is a Kubernetes component that runs on worker nodes and provides pods with access to resources, such as local hardware devices, that require vendor-specific initialization or setup steps. Device Plugins enable the allocation and utilization of specialized hardware resources within the cluster.

- **Disruption**: In Kubernetes, a disruption refers to an event that leads to one or more pods going out of service. Disruptions can be caused by various factors, such as node maintenance, pod eviction, or rolling updates. Disruptions have consequences for workload resources and may require specific handling or mitigation strategies.

- **Docker**: Docker is a software technology that provides operating-system-level virtualization, commonly known as containers. It enables the creation and management of containers, allowing applications to be packaged with their dependencies and run consistently across different environments.

- **Dockershim**: Dockershim is a component of Kubernetes versions 1.23 and earlier. It acts as a compatibility layer between the kubelet and Docker Engine, allowing the kubelet to communicate with Docker Engine to manage containers. Dockershim has been deprecated in favor of the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).

- **Ephemeral Container**: An Ephemeral Container is a type of container that can be temporarily run inside a pod. It is typically used for troubleshooting or diagnostic purposes, allowing users to access the running environment of a pod without modifying its primary containers.

- **Event**: An Event in Kubernetes is a report of an occurrence or state change somewhere in the cluster. Events capture information about activities such as pod creation, scaling, or node failures. They provide a historical record of cluster events and can be used for monitoring, debugging, or auditing purposes.

- **Extensions**: Extensions in Kubernetes refer to software components that extend and deeply integrate with Kubernetes to support new types of hardware, features, or functionalities. Examples of extensions include custom resource definitions, network plugins, storage plugins, and device plugins.

- **Feature Gate**: Feature Gates in Kubernetes are a set of keys (opaque string values) that can

 be used to control which experimental or alpha features are enabled in a cluster. They provide a way to toggle the availability of specific features during runtime and allow for testing and evaluation of new functionality.

- **Finalizer**: A Finalizer is a namespaced key in Kubernetes that tells the system to wait until specific conditions are met before fully deleting resources marked for deletion. Finalizers are used to ensure that cleanup tasks or dependent resources are handled properly before removing the associated object.

- **Garbage Collection**: Garbage Collection in Kubernetes refers to the various mechanisms and processes used to clean up unused or orphaned resources in the cluster. It ensures the proper deletion and release of resources, reclaiming the associated compute, storage, and network resources to maintain cluster efficiency and stability.

- **Image**: In Kubernetes, an Image refers to a stored instance of a container that holds the set of software needed to run an application. Images are typically stored in container registries and are pulled by container runtimes to create and run containers.

- **Init Container**: An Init Container is one or more containers that must run to completion before any app containers start in a pod. Init Containers are commonly used for initialization tasks such as database setup, configuration loading, or data preparation before the main application containers start.

- **Job**: A Job is a Kubernetes API object that represents a finite or batch task that runs to completion. Jobs are used for running tasks or batch jobs that are expected to terminate once their work is done, such as data processing, backups, or one-time computations.

- **kube-controller-manager**: kube-controller-manager is a control plane component in Kubernetes that runs various controller processes. It is responsible for managing different aspects of the cluster, such as replication controllers, endpoints, service accounts, and more.

- **kube-proxy**: kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your Kubernetes cluster. It implements part of the Kubernetes Service concept, providing network load balancing and service discovery functionality. kube-proxy forwards traffic to the appropriate backend pods based on service configurations.

- **Kubectl**: Kubectl is a command-line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane using the Kubernetes API. It allows users to interact with the cluster, manage resources, deploy applications, and perform various administrative tasks.

- **Kubelet**: The Kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for maintaining the desired state of pods, starting and stopping containers, and managing resources on the node. The Kubelet interacts with the control plane to receive instructions and report the status of the node and its containers.

- **Kubernetes API**: The Kubernetes API is the application that serves Kubernetes functionality through a RESTful interface. It provides a standardized way to interact with the cluster, manage resources, and perform operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and querying Kubernetes objects.

- **Label**: Labels in Kubernetes are key-value pairs that can be attached to objects such as pods, services, or deployments. Labels are used to tag or categorize objects based on user-defined attributes. They enable grouping, filtering, and selecting resources for various purposes, such as querying, routing, or applying policies.

- **LimitRange**: A LimitRange in Kubernetes provides constraints to limit resource consumption per containers or pods in a namespace. It allows administrators to define and enforce resource limits, such as CPU or memory usage, ensuring that workloads do not exceed the allocated resources.

- **Logging**: Logging in Kubernetes refers to the practice of capturing and storing a list of events or records that occur within the cluster or applications running on the cluster. Logging provides visibility into system behavior, troubleshooting capabilities, and audit trails for monitoring, debugging, and compliance purposes.

- **Manifest**: A Manifest in Kubernetes refers to a specification of a Kubernetes API object, such as

 a pod, deployment, or service, represented in JSON or YAML format. Manifests define the desired state of the object and are used to create, update, or delete resources within the cluster.

- **Master**: In older versions of Kubernetes, the term "master" was used as a synonym for nodes hosting the control plane components. However, in recent versions, the control plane components are often distributed across multiple nodes for improved scalability and resiliency.

- **Minikube**: Minikube is a tool for running Kubernetes locally on a single machine. It provides a lightweight and easy-to-use Kubernetes environment for development, testing, and learning purposes.

- **Mirror Pod**: A Mirror Pod in Kubernetes is a pod object that the kubelet uses to represent a static pod. Mirror Pods are created and managed directly by the kubelet on a specific node, providing a read-only representation of the static pod's state and enabling external monitoring and control.

- **Name**: In Kubernetes, a Name refers to a client-provided string that uniquely identifies an object in a resource URL. Names are used to reference and identify Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, or namespaces.

- **Namespace**: A Namespace in Kubernetes is an abstraction used to support the isolation and grouping of resources within a single cluster. It provides a virtual cluster within a physical cluster, allowing multiple teams or applications to coexist without interfering with each other.

- **Node**: A Node in Kubernetes refers to a worker machine within the cluster. It can be a physical or virtual machine that runs containers and executes the tasks assigned to it. Nodes are responsible for hosting and running pods, and they provide the necessary compute, storage, and network resources for applications.

- **Object**: An Object in the context of Kubernetes refers to an entity in the Kubernetes system that represents the state of a resource or configuration. Examples of objects include pods, services, deployments, config maps, and persistent volumes. Objects are defined and managed using Kubernetes API resources.

- **Pod**: A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. It represents a logical unit that consists of one or more containers running together on a single node. Pods are the basic building blocks of applications in Kubernetes and provide a cohesive environment for containers to share resources and network connectivity.

- **Pod Lifecycle**: The Pod Lifecycle in Kubernetes refers to the sequence of states that a pod passes through during its lifetime. It includes states such as Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, or Unknown. Each state represents a specific phase or condition of the pod's creation, execution, and termination.

- **Pod Security Policy**: Pod Security Policy (PSP) is a Kubernetes feature that enables fine-grained authorization of pod creation and updates. PSP allows administrators to define security policies that restrict the capabilities of pods, ensuring compliance with security requirements and mitigating potential risks.

- **QoS Class**: QoS Class (Quality of Service Class) in Kubernetes provides a way to classify pods within the cluster into several classes based on resource requirements and guarantees. The QoS class influences scheduling and eviction decisions, ensuring that critical workloads receive the necessary resources and prioritization.

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: RBAC is a security mechanism in Kubernetes that manages authorization decisions. It allows administrators to dynamically configure access policies through the Kubernetes API, defining roles, role bindings, and cluster roles to control user and system access to resources based on assigned permissions.

- **ReplicaSet**: A ReplicaSet in Kubernetes aims to maintain a set of replica pods running at any given time. It ensures the desired number of replicas are running and handles scaling operations based on defined rules. ReplicaSets are commonly used for workload replication, high availability, and load balancing purposes.

- **Resource Quotas**: Resource Quotas in Kubernetes provide constraints that limit the aggregate resource consumption

 per namespace. They allow administrators to set quotas on CPU, memory, storage, and other resources, ensuring fair resource allocation and preventing resource abuse or monopolization by specific applications or teams.

- **Selector**: In Kubernetes, a Selector allows users to filter a list of resources based on labels. Selectors are used to define matching criteria for retrieving specific resources, enabling targeted operations such as applying policies, selecting endpoints, or routing traffic based on label-based selectors.

- **Service**: A Service in Kubernetes is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more pods within the cluster. Services provide a stable endpoint and load balancing for accessing applications, enabling seamless communication between pods and external clients or other services.

- **ServiceAccount**: A ServiceAccount in Kubernetes provides an identity for processes that run in a pod. It allows pods to authenticate with the Kubernetes API server and access resources or perform operations based on the assigned permissions and roles.

- **Shuffle-sharding**: Shuffle-sharding is a technique used in Kubernetes for assigning requests to queues, providing better isolation than simple hashing modulo the number of queues. It helps distribute requests evenly and prevent hotspots or resource contention in distributed systems.

- **StatefulSet**: A StatefulSet in Kubernetes manages the deployment and scaling of a set of pods, providing guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these pods. StatefulSets are commonly used for stateful applications that require stable network identities, ordered deployment, and persistent storage.

- **Static Pod**: A Static Pod in Kubernetes is a pod managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node. Unlike regular pods that are created using the Kubernetes API server, static pods are defined as static manifest files placed in a specific directory on the node. The kubelet monitors and manages these pods automatically.

- **Taint**: A Taint in Kubernetes is a core object consisting of three required properties: key, value, and effect. Taints are used to mark nodes or node groups with specific restrictions, preventing the scheduling of pods that do not tolerate the taints. Taints are typically used for specialized nodes or to segregate workloads.

- **Toleration**: A Toleration in Kubernetes is a core object consisting of three required properties: key, value, and effect. Toleration allows pods to tolerate or ignore specific taints on nodes, enabling their scheduling on nodes or node groups that have matching taints. Toleration and taints work together to provide fine-grained node affinity and anti-affinity.

- **UID**: UID (Unique Identifier) in Kubernetes refers to a systems-generated string that uniquely identifies objects within the cluster. Each Kubernetes resource, such as pods, services, or config maps, is assigned a unique UID, which remains consistent throughout the object's lifetime.

- **Volume**: A Volume in Kubernetes refers to a directory containing data that is accessible to the containers within a pod. Volumes provide a way to persist data, share files between containers, or mount external storage systems into pods. Kubernetes supports various types of volumes, such as emptyDir, hostPath, persistentVolumeClaim, and more.

- **Workload**: A Workload in Kubernetes refers to an application or a set of applications running on the cluster. It represents the desired state and resource requirements for running containers or pods that form part of an application stack. Workloads include deployments, stateful sets, daemon sets, and jobs, among others.
